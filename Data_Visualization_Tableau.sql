/* GUIDED PROJECT VISUALIZATION - ALEX THE ANALYST
   
   DATA SET - COVID-19 
   
   Website: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus 


1> At frst, we have placed the population column after the date column in the excel sheet 
	and then we have splitted the data set in to 2
      - CovidDeaths
      - CovidVaccination
2> We have converted the dataset CSV format to .xlsx format whihc would help to connect to MSsql
3> Using the option 'SQL server 2019 import and export' option we can import the data from excel to sql.
